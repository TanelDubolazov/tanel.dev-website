      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">The Person Behind the Code</h2>
      <p>
        I've always been driven by curiosity â€“ whether it was diving into the complex worlds of Asimov's Foundation series, 
        mastering the strategic depths of games like Civilization, or simply breaking my toys apart as a kid to see
        what makes them work.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        While my professional focus is on backend engineering and DevOps, my previous experience in marketing and varied interests in 
        literature, gaming, and motorsports give me a unique perspective on problem-solving and user experience. 
        I find that the worlds we imagine often inspire the technologies we create.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">My Working Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I think one of the most important skills to a technical role is methodical thinking. Breaking things apart to their 
        smallest details into bite sized pieces which we can digest, otherwise anything could seem overwhelming. This is Something
        I've learned to do both in my marketing projects and more recently with software development, as projects grow and become more
        complex.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I also believe that an extremely important component to any kind of efficient specialist is self-awareness. Understanding your limitations
        while not limiting yourself, it's an incredibly difficult thing to balance. Should I use LLM to help me complete this project? Should I try 
        a new framework or how do I avoid overengineering a simple application? All of that is hard to balance but I believe that with self-awareness,
        time managament and the courage to try something new anything is possible and if I fail, I guess I've learned something new.
